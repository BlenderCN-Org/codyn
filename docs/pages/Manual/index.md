Getting started with codyn.

This manual contains all the information you need to get started with codyn. If
you are not yet familiar with codyn, please go ahead and read the <Introduction>
first. This should give you a good idea of what codyn is exactly and how you can
use it.

The other sections of this manual describe various topics of working with codyn.
<libcodyn> describes on a high-level how to work with the codyn library, while
the modeling (syntax) is explained in <Modeling>.
The tools distributed with codyn are described in <Tools>.
The last chapter, <Bindings> shows how codyn can be used from other languages
such as python or matlab.
