# Codyn documentation

Welcome to the codyn documentation page. Here you will find all information necessary to get you started
with codyn. The <Manual> provides a high level overview of the design, concepts and implementation of
the codyn framework. The <API Reference> provides documentation of the core <Manual::libcodyn> C API which
is used to create applications using codyn.

*Note that many of the pages in the <Manual> are currently only stubs and have yet to be written. We are
currently in the process of writing the <Manual>, please check back later for updates.*
