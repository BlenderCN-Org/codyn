<title>Principles and Concepts</title>
<para>
The CPG network library is a general dynamical systems simulator. Although as
the name suggests it focusses on implementing Central Pattern Generators, it
can basicly be used to model any kind of dynamical system.
</para>
<para>
The library takes an Object Oriented approach into modelling a dynamical system.
Such a system then consists of a number of state containers, which each contain
any number of state variables. In programming terms these are simply objects
with a certain set of properties assigned to them. Each property furthermore is
a mathematical expression which can reference other properties from the 
object in which it is defined. For instance, you could have a property 
<emphasis>a = 1</emphasis> and <emphasis>b = 2 * a</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
Apart from state containers, you can transmit <emphasis>information</emphasis>
from one state container to another, with a certain transfer function, using
links. A link simply connects two containers together and defines a set of
<emphasis>actions</emphasis>. An action consists of a target property in the
object to which it links, and a mathematical expression which transfers a
value to that target property at each simulation step of the system. This
transfer function can use any properties from the object it originates from.
</para>
<para>
Now, this is not strictly a dynamical system yet, since it only is able to set 
a property to a specific value at each time step. However, any property can be 
marked to be integrated during simulation. The result of this is that when such 
property is targeted by a link, the resulting value will be multiplied by the 
timestep and added to the current value of that property. Furthermore, multiple 
links can act on the same property, resulting in all their respective 
transmitted values being added to the property.
</para>
<para>
To illustrate this with a simple example, take the following first order
non-linear dynamical system:
</para>
<inlinegraphic fileref="exmath.png" format="PNG" />
<para>
To model this simple system using the library we need one state container
with an <emphasis>x</emphasis>, <emphasis>g_x</emphasis> and 
<emphasis>X</emphasis> property. The initial values of these properties should
be chosen such that the system actually does something interesting, for example
respective values 0.1, 1 and 1 could be taken. Furthermore we mark
<emphasis>x</emphasis> to be integrated.

<programlisting language="C" linenumbering="numbered">
<![CDATA[CpgNetwork *network = cpg_network_new ();
CpgObject *object = CPG_OBJECT (cpg_state_new ("state"));

cpg_object_add_property (object, "x", "0.1", TRUE);
cpg_object_add_property (object, "g_x", "1", FALSE);
cpg_object_add_property (object, "X", "1", FALSE);

cpg_network_add_object (network, object);]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
As defined above, the network will not do anything when being simulated since
we only defined some states. To model the equation as specified above, we
need to add a link to the system transfering information. Since nothing
prevents us from adding a link from and to the same object, we do just that.
The link should have one action, targetting the <emphasis>x</emphasis> property
and transferring information as defined in the equation:

<programlisting language="C" linenumbering="numbered">
/* Continue with example above */
CpgLink *link = cpg_link_new ("integration", object, object);

cpg_link_add_action (link, 
                     cpg_object_get_property (object, "x"),
                     "g_x * (X * X - x * x) * x");

cpg_network_add_object (network, CPG_OBJECT (link));
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Now the network is complete it can be simulated using 
<link linkend="cpg-network-run">cpg_network_run</link>.
<note>
Links are just another type of object, as such they can also have properties
(although these can not be targed by links themselves). You can use these
properties in the link actions. This can be useful if you need to precalculate
some value and use it in several link actions in the same link.
</note>
</para>

<title>Construction</title>
<para>
There are basicly two ways to create a new network. The first is simply by
using <link linkend="cpg-network-new">cpg_network_new</link> to create an empty
network. After the network is created, you can start building it by adding 
states and links to the network using <link linkend="cpg-network-add-object">
cpg_network_add_object</link> (as done above). Although you might be able to 
construct fairly simple networks like this quite easily, at some point your 
networks will become bigger and more complex. To this end, you can write the 
network using
the <link linkend="xml-specification">CPG Network XML specification</link>. 
Once written, you can construct a network from such a file using
<link linkend="cpg-network-new-from-file">cpg_network_new_from_file</link>. To
illustrate, the example system defined above can be written in XML format
as follows:

<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="numbered">
<![CDATA[<cpg>
  <network>
    <state id="state">
      <property name="x" integrated="yes">0.1</property>
      <property name="g_x">1</property>
      <property name="X">1</property>
    </state>
    <link id="integration" from="state" to="state">
      <action target="x">g_x * (X * X - x * x) * x</action>
    </link>
  </network>
</cpg>]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
After a network has been loaded from the XML file, you can manipulate in the
same way as if it was constructed by hand. This means you can modify some
properties of objects in the network or add and remove states and links
as needed.
</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1>
<title>Manipulating a Network</title>
<para>
Every aspect of the network can be manipulated using the network API. There are
a few methods in particular that are used to retrieve objects and set or get
certain properties of those objects.
</para>
<para>
To get a specific object from the network, you can use 
<link linkend="cpg-network-get-object">cpg_network_get_object</link> using the
objects unique id. To get a list of all the states in the network, use
<link linkend="cpg-network-get-states">cpg_network_get_states</link> and for
a list of links use <link linkend="cpg-network-get-links">cpg_network_get_links</link>.
</para>
<para>
Each object in the network basicly consists of a set of properties which 
contain mathematical expressions. To get a specific property from an object
you can use <link linkend="cpg-object-get-property">cpg_object_get_property</link>.
Similar to getting all states from the network, you can use
<link linkend="cpg-object-get-properties">cpg_object_get_properties</link> to
get a list of all properties on an object. The functions
<link linkend="cpg-object-add-property">cpg_object_add_property</link> and
<link linkend="cpg-object-remove-property">cpg_object_remove_property</link>
can be used to respectively add and remove properties from the object.
</para>
<para>
To get the current value of a <link linkend="cpg-network-cpg-property">CpgProperty</link>
you can use <link linkend="cpg_property_get_value">cpg_property_get_value</link>.
Similarly, use 
<link linkend="cpg_property_set_value_expression">cpg_property_set_value_expression</link>
to set the value of a property to a mathematical expression.
<note>
Make sure that your network has been compiled 
(<link linkend="cpg-network-compile">cpg_network_compile</link>) before
accessing the property value with 
<link linkend="cpg-property-get-value">cpg_property_get_value</link>.
</note>
</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1>
<title>Using global variables</title>
<para>
One thing that might be useful to know is that you can define global accessible
variables within the network. Two special globals are already defined by
default, they signify the network simulation time (<emphasis>t</emphasis>) and
the current simulation step size (<emphasis>dt</emphasis>). The time variable
in particular can be useful when experimenting with perturbing some values
in the network using simple conditional statements equivalent to the ternary
operator many programming languages (<emphasis>t &lt; 2 ? 1 : 0</emphasis>).
</para>
<para>
In network terminology, global variables are defined within a special
<link linkend="CpgObject">CpgObject</link> which you can access
as any other object in the network (thus using 
<link linkend="cpg-object-add-property">cpg_object_add_property</link> to add
new global properties). Use 
<link linkend="cpg-network-get-globals">cpg_network_get_globals</link> to
get the networks' globals object.
</para>
